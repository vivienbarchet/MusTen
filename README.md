# MusTen

MusTen is a python-based project aiming at predicting musical tension for a given piece from a set of automatically extracted musical features. 

The tension prediction relies on the trend salience model developed by Farbood (2012). We enhanced this model by introducing automatic feature extraction methods, adjusting the tension prediction process, and optimizing the model on a set of 17 western classical pieces. 

Details about the automization process and the model optimization can be found here: 

This repository contains: 
- Notebooks defining our custom functions for the tension prediction and the feature extraction 
- Two example notebooks explaining the feature extraction and the tension prediction 

- All music files we used during the model optimization 
- Our behavioral data (raw and sampled at 50 Hz as well as filtered and sampled at 10 Hz)
